# How to burn a DVD on Windows

## Getting started
Duration: 0:05

To install Ubuntu on a computer that currently runs Windows you need to [download](https://www.ubuntu.com/download) the installation file, if you want to [verify the download](/tutorial/tutorial-how-to-verify-ubuntu) and then burn it onto the DVD, which you can then use to install Ubuntu.

Once you’ve downloaded the file, follow the instructions below to burn your DVD, depending on which version of Windows you are currently using.
