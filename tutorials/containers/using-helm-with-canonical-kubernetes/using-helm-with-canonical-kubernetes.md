# Using Helm with Canonical Kubernetes

## Overview
Duration: 2:00

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications. Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes. It allows describing the application structure through convenient helm-charts and managing it with simple commands.

### What you'll learn

- How to deploy Helm 
- How to deploy a chart

### You will only need

- a Charmed Kubernetes cluster

positive
: If you do not have a Charmed Kubernetes cluster, you can refer to the following [tutorial](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/get-started-charmed-kubernetes) to spin up one in minutes. Charmed Kubernetes is a production-grade Kubernetes offering from Canonical which is fully compliant with the upstream project.

Survey
: How will you use this tutorial?
 - Only read through it
 - Read it and complete the exercises
: What is your current level of experience?
 - Novice
 - Intermediate
 - Proficient

## Prepare your cluster
Duration: 2:00

Make sure that your Kubernetes cluster is running and kubectl config is in `~/.kube/config`.

`juju scp kubernetes-master/0:config ~/.kube/config`

Also make sure you have opened the Helm port 44134 on all your worker nodes:

```
juju exec --app kubernetes-worker "open-port 44134"
```

## Deploy Helm
Duration: 5:00

We can deploy Helm using the snap or from an installer script. 

positive
: Helm 3.0 introduced new features that include changes in the chart installation process and removal of in-cluster (Tiller) component and default repositories. This tutorial will include directions for both versions.

### Deploy using snap 

```
sudo apt-get install snapd
```

For Helm 3:

```
sudo snap install helm --classic
```

For Helm 2:

```
sudo snap install helm --channel=2.16/stable --classic
```

### Deploy from script

Helm now has an [installer script](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/scripts/get-helm-3) that will automatically grab the latest version of Helm and install it locally. You can fetch that script and then execute it locally. It’s well documented so that you can read through it and understand what it is doing before you run it.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 > get_helm.sh
```

For Helm 2 we can use another [installer script](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/scripts/get) from the official repository:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get > get_helm.sh
```

This will download Helm from GitHub. Now we are ready to deploy the binary. 
```
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

For Helm 2 we will need to run the init command and check the status of the Tiller pods:

```
helm init
kubectl -n kube-system get pods
```

Helm should now be ready to roll on your cluster. 

## Deploying a Chart
Duration: 7:00

A chart is a Helm package that contains information sufficient for installing a set of Kubernetes resources into a Kubernetes cluster. Charts contain a Chart.yaml file as well as templates, default values (values.yaml), and dependencies.

After release 3.0.0 Helm changed the experience with repositories and now no longer includes stable charts repository by default. 
So one of the first things to do is to add repositories that contain charts that we want. We can search [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/) and usually chart's page contains the link to the repository.
And we can also add stable repository which will be supported by Helm Hub until May 13, 2020. You can skip this step if you are using Helm 2.

```
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
```

After repositories are added we need to run an update to get the latest charts:

`helm repo update`

Next we can search charts in our repos. For Helm 3:

```
helm search repo docker-registry
NAME                    CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION                     
stable/docker-registry  1.8.3        	2.7.1      	A Helm chart for Docker Registry
```
For Helm 2:

```
helm search docker-registry
NAME                  	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION                     
stable/docker-registry	1.8.3        	2.7.1      	A Helm chart for Docker Registry
```
And finally we can install a simple chart. For Helm 3:

`helm install docker-registry stable/docker-registry`

For Helm 2:

```
helm install stable/docker-registry
```

### Writing a Chart
If you want to write your own chart take a look at the full guide provided in the [Helm Manual](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/).

## That's all folks!
Duration: 1:00

Congratulations! In this tutorial, you installed Helm on Charmed Kubernetes and deployed a simple docker-registry chart.
