# How to install Neovim on Ubuntu Desktop 18.04 LTS

## Overview
Duration: 1:00

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a free and open source text editor that is an extension of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), the ubiquitous text editor. The project began in 2014 and has continued to rapidly grow over the years, into a modern text editor that is extensible and maintainable. 

Neovim and Vim share the same configuration syntax, file and commands, therefore if you are already a Vim user who is interested in Neovim, transitioning to the text editor will be friction-less.

This tutorial will show you how to install Neovim from the command line and operate the text editor from your Ubuntu Desktop.
